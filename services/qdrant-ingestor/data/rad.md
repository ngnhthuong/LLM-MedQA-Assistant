# Radiology Summary – Headache and Diabetes

## Headache Imaging Findings
Computed tomography (CT) of the brain is commonly performed in patients presenting with acute severe headache to exclude intracranial hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be indicated when secondary causes such as tumors or vascular malformations are suspected.

## Diabetes-Related Imaging
In patients with long-standing diabetes mellitus, imaging may reveal complications such as diabetic nephropathy or vascular calcifications. MRI can also demonstrate ischemic changes related to chronic microvascular disease.

## Clinical Relevance
Radiological findings must be interpreted in conjunction with clinical presentation and laboratory results to guide appropriate management.
